# SE-300-VOCALOID
Welcome to the SE-300 vocaloid project Risea. In order to get started on
coding for this project look the the getting started section

# Getting Started
In order to get started clone both this git repository and 
Our fork of the JUCE library at https://github.com/SpoonFll/JUCE_Sampling

make sure to clone so that file structure is SE-300-VOCALOID/Risea/JUCE

once that is done run cmake -B build and cmake --build build to build the binary for your platform
after it has built you can now run the program
